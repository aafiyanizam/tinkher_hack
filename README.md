Project Description
The Recipe Generator is a web application that helps users generate creative and delicious recipes based on their preferences. Users can either select from predefined categories (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Dessert, Snacks) or input custom ingredients to get a unique recipe. The app also allows users to download the recipe as a PDF or listen to it using text-to-speech.

The Problem Statement
Coming up with new and exciting recipes can be challenging, especially when you're short on time or ingredients. People often struggle to find inspiration or don't know how to use the ingredients they have at home.

The Solution
The Recipe Generator solves this problem by using AI to generate creative and easy-to-follow recipes. Whether you want a quick breakfast idea or a custom recipe based on the ingredients in your fridge, this app has you covered. It even provides step-by-step instructions and allows you to download or listen to the recipe for convenience.
